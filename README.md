# LIGO Relativity Tensor ML

## Overview
This repository contains Python code that simulates and visualizes the connection between LIGO gravitational wave data analysis and relativistic tensor transformations. The code demonstrates how gravitational wave signals can be represented as energy tensors and analyzed through the lens of special relativity.

## Features
- **Gravitational Wave Simulation**: Generates realistic LIGO-like strain data with a simulated chirp signal
- **Spectrogram Analysis**: Converts time-domain strain data to frequency-time representation
- **Stress-Energy Tensor**: Constructs a simplified stress-energy tensor from the energy distribution
- **Lorentz Transformations**: Applies relativistic transformations to the tensors
- **Machine Learning Tensor Operations**: Demonstrates tensor reshaping operations relevant for ML applications
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Multiple plots showing the relationship between GW data and relativistic effects

The video above demonstrates the visualization output from running the code, including:
- The animated gravitational wave signal detection
- Spectrogram transformation showing frequency evolution
- Dynamic tensor transformations under different Lorentz boosts
- Energy distribution visualization with relativistic effects

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Simply run the main script:
```bash
python ligo_relativity_tensor.py
```

This will generate several visualizations:
1. Time-domain strain data with highlighted GW chirp
2. Spectrogram showing the energy distribution across time and frequency
3. Lorentz factor curve showing relativistic effects at different velocities
4. Original stress-energy tensor visualization
5. Lorentz-transformed tensor visualization
6. Lorentz transformation matrix
7. Log-scaled energy distribution with contours

## Mathematical Background

### Gravitational Wave Data
The code simulates LIGO strain data that would be produced when a gravitational wave from a binary merger passes through the detector. The chirp signal increases in both frequency and amplitude as the binary system's components spiral inward.

### Stress-Energy Tensor
In general relativity, the stress-energy tensor (T^μν) describes the density and flux of energy and momentum. In our simplified 2D case:
- T^00: Energy density component
- T^11: Pressure component

### Lorentz Transformation
The Lorentz transformation shows how the stress-energy tensor components change when viewed from a reference frame moving at relative velocity v:
- γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²) (Lorentz factor)
- The transformation matrix Λ^μ_ν transforms the tensor as: T'^μν = Λ^μ_α Λ^ν_β T^αβ

## Code Structure
- **Strain Data Generation**: Creates time-domain data with a chirp signal and colored noise
- **Spectrogram Creation**: Transforms strain data into time-frequency representation
- **Tensor Construction**: Builds stress-energy tensor from energy distribution
- **Relativistic Analysis**: Applies Lorentz transformation to the tensor
- **Visualization**: Creates comprehensive plots of all the above elements

## Applications
This code bridges concepts from:
- Gravitational wave astronomy
